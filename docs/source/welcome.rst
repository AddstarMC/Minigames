Welcome to the Minigames Documentation! The home of everything to do with
Minigames. This wiki is still under construction, and is in need of
expanding.

Minigames was created for players to play games within a server and win
prizes for completion, also to let players play PvP games without the
risk of losing their hard earned items and XP. Minigames also rewards
players for completing each Minigame, or with PvP Minigames, the player
can be rewarded with 'bets' that players make before they start the
Minigame. These bets can be in Economy money or preset items.

These Minigames can be created in any style the player wishes, for
example, parkour jump puzzles, mazes and treasure hunts. As well as PvP
games like CTF, races and more. You are given a lot of options to add to
each Minigame individually, so they are all completely customisable.

Updating to 1.15
""""""""""""""""

It is highly likely some games will need fixing after updating.


#. 
   Ensure all your games are fully restored before shutting down.  Backup data will not work properly. Make config backups.

#. 
   SwapBlockActions and SetBlockActions will require updating after the restore if they used special data.
